#X text 5 29 "HID" stands for "Human Interface Device". A HID is any
device that is meant to allow humans to interact with a computer. Usually
\, HIDs are mice \, keyboards \, joysticks \, tablets \, gamepads \,
etc. There a number of unusual HIDs \, like the Griffin PowerMate on
the low end \, or the SensAble PHANTOM 6DOF on the high end.;

#X text 435 478 There are quite a few objects that support HIDs from
many different sources. Here are a bunch whose functionality is available
in the [hid] object \, so it is recommended that you do not use these
objects any more.;

#X text 434 334 While it does not make sense to use a poll rate that
is much faster than the refresh rate of the device \, it does make
sense to make the poll rate somewhat faster. If you poll at the same
rate as the device refreshes \, you could get up to double the latency
\, i.e. if [hid] polls right before the event is reported.;
#X text 425 461 DEPRECATED OBJECTS;
#X text 5 117 When talking about HIDs \, "DOF" is often mentioned.
"DOF" stands for "degrees of freedom". A degree of freedom is one dimension
in which that HID can give information. A mouse generally had 2DOFs:
X-axis and Y-axis \, though a wheel could be considered another DOF.
The PHANTOM 6DOF device has six degrees of freedom: X \, Y \, Z movement
\; X \, Y \, Z rotation.;

#X obj 11 347 hid;
#X text 11 369 Basically any device that is supported by the various
HID layers on each OS is supported by the [hid] object. So any of those
devices can be used as controllers with Pd. There already exists a
number of objects for more common HIDs:;
#X text 434 39 An essential detail to making an usable instrument is
the latency between when you perform an action and the sound it produces.
If the latency is too large \, it will make the instrument annoying
to play \, or even unplayable. So the aim is to have as low latency
as possible. To put it into perspective \, if you were playing an electric
guitar and the amp was 3m (10ft) away from you \, there would be a
9ms delay between when you plucked the string and when you heard the
sound.;

#X text 3 453 PLATFORM-SPECIFIC HID OBJECTS;
#X obj 254 527 linuxmouse;
#X text 15 470 To get full access to some devices \, you need to use
the platform-specific objects. The objects have dummy versions on the
other platforms so that you open the patches on other platforms and
edit them without breaking them.;
#X text 5 254 These objects are quite simple to use \, but are limited.
They only receive key events when Pd has focus \; they output alternating
1s and 0s to represent auto-repeat \; [key] and [heyup] are limited
to the 'printing' characters. [keyname] reports Shift \, Ctrl \, Alt
\, Meta \, etc.;
