[b] pd-dev message to Ed Kelly, October 5.
[b] GOP problems are back due to recent changes in canvas_map and canvas_vis.
    now that abstractions don't get loaded into the client anymore, GOP can't always be drawn anymore too.
     i mean, because the content of GOP is not uploaded to the client, so the client can't draw anything about it..
     unless def View outside_of_the_box are moved to the server side and the server only uploads what needs to be drawn
     for gop

     another side effect of not uploading the content of [pd]/abs that i just found out is that, when deleting such object,
     1. the client won't be able to perform things like $wire deconstruct in def Canvas del,
        as the object don't exists in the client side
     2. even if client don't call things like that, the server would still send -> delete message to the client,
        which causes the same error because the object don't exists...

[s] it might make sense to always upload subpatches but upload instances only when needed
[s] server don't send delete message back after client sending "object_delete" (http://pastebin.ca/318343)
[s] serial got sent too early when creating [pd] with push & #N canvas (http://pastebin.ca/318318)
[s] GOP problems are back due to recent changes in canvas_map and canvas_vis
[s] [route] should be reconfigurable and accept pointer
[s] [select] should accept pointer
[s] [moses] should be multi-arg (and be aliased to [range] ?)
[s] get rid of stderr in server
[s] prevent hidden subpatches/abstraction-instances from being loaded in the client all of the time.
[s] -lib in .pdrc crashes server: http://pastebin.ca/286300
[s] server don't pick up changes via NumBox reload, ie the width:
    <- .x8068058 reload 2 14 -1e+37 1e+37 0 0 empty empty empty 0 -6 0 8 -262144 -1 -1 0 256;
    -> change x8068058 x8067c50 {#X obj 335 166 nbx 8 14 -1e+37 1e+37 0 0 empty empty empty 0 -6 0 8 -262144 -1 -1 0 256;}
[b] fix gop
    [c] reimplement View get_canvas so that it does not rely on [focus]
    [s] gop contains can be drawn if not uploaded to client
[ ] fix deleteing/closing Canvas
    [ ] server sends -> x806a3b8 delete twice
    [ ] fix deletion order
[ ] graphical array rendering optimisation
[ ] fix double delete of [pd]; this is because [pd] is both an object in a patch and a patch itself, and "subscribe" doesn't distinguish.
[s] added "version 2" syntax parser (optional), which has nested lists,
    extended quoting, extended float syntax
    (some ex-symbols now parsed as floats: +1 +1.0 +1e8 0x10 and so on.)
[ ] atomically with multiple level
[ ] tidy_up/snap to grid
[ ] cleaner parsing of [expr]... remove int type because it causes e.g. [expr 8.0 / 10.0] = 0 but [expr 8.0/10.0] = 0.8
[ ] how does [declare -stdpath] work? this is a mystery. can't get it to work in pd 0.40.

[ ] PureUnity
    [ ] benchmark
    [ ] signals
    [ ] grids
    [ ] transitive, antisymmetric, predicate

[s] those are the externs that have to be recompiled if I want to trap calls to return values of getfn.

  ./externals/grill/dynext/src/main.cpp:952: mess1((t_pd *)canvas,const_cast<t_symbol *>(sym_dsp),NULL);

<shift8> matju: another big bug for me - v/h sliders in existing patches bounce
 repeatedly back to bottom when some kind of event occurs.  you have to move the
 mouse very gently back and forth until the slider stays at the location you want,
 then without moving the mouse, release the mouse button :(

[s] allow helpfiles to load without having to "make install".
[s] switch iemguis to using only t_atoms
[s] MIDI loopback pseudo-device (inside pd)
[s] audio loopback pseudo-device (inside pd)

[c] opening an already-open subpatch should just raise that subpatch
[c] bug: you can move parts of gop subpatches, from the parent patch!
[c] pixel offsets are not correct in [hsl] [vsl]:
    distinguish between $@w or $@h and actual size. there should be 4 extra pixels.
[c] hide inlets/outlets of IEMGUI when they have receive-symbols/send-symbols
[c] rightclick help doesn't work on [cnv]: tries to find help for "cnv.pd" ???
[s] creating a graph causes crash.
[b] fix NumBox's width and height (or remove those settings)
[x] Implement (or fix) Find, Find Again in class Client
    [x] with ability to search substrings

[c] patching-in-tongues follow-up
[c] take care of needless "save changes?"
[c] make List objects, to manage children, visible_children, wires, selection, selection_wires.

[b] #V test with bg color
[c] kill global tooltip variable ?
[c] iemprops: min,max labels broken

[b] implement garray
[c] implement a mark-and-sweep in order to find leaks... (?)
[b] rewrite [image], [display], [knob], [grid], [popup], ...
[ ] this seems fishy but might have good ideas -> http://www.rebelscience.org/Cosas/Reliability.htm
[c] make a statistical profiler for Tcl, if possible
[c] try to use profiler.tcl (tcllib) in a sensible way
[s] try C-oriented tools:
    [ ] oprofile (with GUI)
    [ ] memprof
    [ ] sysprof
    [ ] kprof
    [ ] gprof
    [ ] prospect

[s] iirc, bang~ registers a timer callback. the problem is that the timer callbacks are only executed every dac block,
    which is 64 samples. so running bang~ in subpatch with less than 64 samples, bang~ sets the same timer several times,
    but it's only executed once.

[b] think about this «if you are reconsidering properties panels, I strongly encourage all y'all to make them Pd patches.
    This is how Max/MSP does it and I think it would work very well for Pd as well.  Sounds like this is a good opportunity
    to make the switch.» -- hcs

    [c] a hotkey to drag the "points" (where two lines meet)
    [c] a modifier key to delete a segment (actually the others should be that way too)
    [c] you should be able to right click on a regular wire, and press "segment" or do a hotkey with it
        and it automatically turns it into an straight-elbow multisegmented wire
[b] [t a] could be a very small GUI object (called "null object")
[b] all the [t] could be GUI objects
[b] GUI objects for [inlet] and [outlet] and [pd] ([page])
[-] make a sort of pd-extended, call it DesireData Express or (gasp) Extraordinaire.

[s] symbol vs strings: Ruby is right: the Symbol vs String distinction is annoying and possibly obsolete.
    according to me, symbols exist mostly because LISP had them before they had strings, and because most
    Strings implementations aren't powerful enough to be as fast (or almost as fast) as Symbols.
    (well, for compatibility reasons, just like in Ruby, we can't remove symbol support completely, but
    at least we can reduce the difference between strings and symbols to a minimum.)

[b] server-side IEMGUI could be turned into Tcl-based externs OR EVEN become abstractions.
    it's possible to make a DesireData GUI for any Pd class, including abstractions.
    to turn IEMGUI into an abstraction, what's missing is the savefn/saveargs/scanargs business.

[s] I would like to know how much it is feasible to compress the t_atom
    structure so that even with 64-bit pointers the t_atom still stays 8 bytes
    instead of 16. I think it's possible, but not necessarily in a
    backwards-compatible way, and not necessarily in a portable way. also maybe it's not that useful.

[c] splashscreen: we could make it different than other programs by inserting the splashscreen
    inside the main window or we could make it a separate window but no timer, just an [OK] button,
    so actually, this would be exactly the same as the "About" dialog.

[s] turn [makefilename] into something that doesn't suck. (alias it to [sprintf] or [format])

[s] merge martin peach's tcp externs into the core
[b] data inspector: when this tool is enabled, it prints on the console any data coming through whatever cable you
    currently have selected. if you select multiple wires, it reports whats going through multiple wires.
[b] you need a way to see cpu usage on individual objects or on patchers or on groups of selected objects
[c] objectbox history: see whether ddrc should have a history count entry;
    think about saving history; matju thought that it could be turned into a dynamic button bar that you can drag from.
[?] send to front, send to back
[c] make windows not get auto-resized to the width of the toolbar, so that people can have tiny windows.
[c] <Dossy> fconfigure -encoding binary ...
[s] implement the stuff that is in iostreams.txt

[c] Luke Iannini suggests some OSX bindings:
    Command-` to switch between different windows within the application.
    Command-, to bring up preferences (though this one is more difficult since there are multiple preference windows...)
    Command-m to minimize the window (this currently brings up the "send message" dialogue box)

[s] Claude:
    Sending a message to vline~ creates a t_vseg, which are stored in a
    sorted linear linked list, which means the time taken to add each new
    line segment would be O(n), where n is the number of existing line segments.

[-] look at some object sync protocols that we can think of: NFS for folders, palm sync for calendars, rsync for file contents

Marius Schebella:
I have a small keyboard shortcut wish: change between "entering mode" and "selected mode" with boxes.
when I create a new object/message... then it would be nice to have a
shortcut that switches from the mode, where the cursor is in the box to the
mode, where the object is selected. I think the tab-key could be used for
that. As it is now, I type something in, then I have to grab the mouse, then
klick, then select, then I can adjust it (which I also do with the keyboard,
because it is more precise).
I know the toggeling will not be possible when more objects are selected,
but maybe someone has an idea for that.

[c] command for unpatcherizing a subpatch or abstraction (useful for making variants)
    or for turning an abstraction into a subpatch.

[s] I fixed it now, but I don't know if this is not a bug in pd 0.40:

"The problem is, that canvas-local search path really tread each path as local to the canvas-path ( see line 1561 in g_canvas.c).
So if you add e.g. /usr/local/lib/pd/extra/iemmatrix, it will search for this path, but local to the canvas path - so if I started
Pd from /home/me it will search in /home/me//usr/local/lib/pd/extra/iemmatrix ! Is this a feature or a bug of Pd ?" -- Holzi

[s] "I don't quite understand how this explains why wrap~ of -1 returns 1." -- steffen

[s] there's a [wrap~] but no [wrap]. there's a [>] but no [>~] (without externals). -- matju

dmotd about converting patches to postscript:
"the internal pd postscript printer grabs the viewable canvas size,
this would need to change to encompass the virtual limits of the patch.
tcl/tk's 'canvas postscript' command takes the -width -height flags,
so making it the virtual bounds is trivial. this works for snapshotting
canvas bounds:  sys_vgui("set cnv_bbox [.x%x.c bbox all] \n  .x%x.c
postscript -file /tmp/canvas.ps -width [lindex $cnv_bbox 2] -height
[lindex $cnv_bbox 3]  \n ", canvas, canvas);

1. there's no way to limit the size of the output buffer. If the other
side of the connection doesn't respond, the sending buffer just
inflates quickly. I've seen it happen that a bug in the sender causes
it to try to send so fast that it ate memory like an infinite recursion
or a forkbomb.

2. That operation is not realtime-safe (but still it's much closer to
being so than just blocking...)

3. It's only usable by the GUI socket and never by [netsend].

4. While that buffer together with t_guiqueue allow GUI updates to be
delayed for as long as necessary, it doesn't solve the problem that it can
send information that is already outdated and redundant. This can be
important in preventing problem #1 for a very heavy GUI. DesireData has
had this problem essentially dealt with since a long time, but it lacks
some fine tuning to get more robust.

<arjen> matju, you may be interested in "Jim" - that does have closures and on the Wiki you can find several attempts and
        experiments regarding closures: http://wiki.tcl.tk/closures

<matju> is there something like listbox but which works as a popup menu ?
<tclguy> tk_optionMenu is an old-school version
<tclguy> or get a combobox from BWidget or tile

1. wish8.5 desire.tk city.pd &> err
2. ctrl+e, ctrl+a, shift+right*3 (or just once if profiling)
3. times (tclx)

<matju> is there a wrapper for libagg for tcl? AGG of antigrain.com
<ijchain> <kbk> don't know of one, but SWIG, Critcl, or ffidl might plug the gap

[initbang] & [closebang]: https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=478072&aid=1544041&group_id=55736

[s] Ed Kelly <morph_2016@yahoo.co.uk> reports that ALSA 24-bit output does not work?

to dave griffiths: I think that this is three feature requests:
1. performing replacement of wire-object-wire by a single wire, as a
single operation in the GUI
2. make that operation atomic in terms of DSP recompilation.
3. break down DSP recompilation in pieces so that it is more "incremental"
for large patches.
In the case of object insertion, (2) and (3) are not implemented either,
but step (1) already has most of the desired effect; for the message
system, step (1) is all that is needed. DSP is more work and I know less
about DSP. It'll take me a while to get there; but (2) doesn't seem so
hard.

http://www.tomsawyer.com/gallery/index.php

[b] matju to atwood:
  If I had automatic positioning in DesireData, it would be as an option: e.g. objects could default to "floating around"
  (that is, automatic positioning), but be pinned down into specific positions. In that case, an exception has to be done
  for [inlet] and [outlet] objects mostly. (the DS subsystem should be skipped over as well...) I could also have a use
  for some semi-automatic repositionings: for example, there could be a keyboard shortcut to reposition a non-"floating"
  object wherever it would go if it were floating, and if the user doesn't want it s/he can Ctrl+z it.

http://www.graphdrawing.org/

<mamalala> you select a bunch of objects and group them together .... then you can select all the objects in that group
later, if needed, by its name like, you start to build some mixer patch .. and then you add a chain for an external fx,
so you can put all associated objects in the "ext.fx" group ... whenever it gets so messed up that you forgot what is
what, you can just select the groupt you want, and see/move/whatever the involved objects the group name could also act
as a template for the name of a subpatch, if one decides to finally put them into one ....

[PD] interface wishlist
tim info at timvets.net
Sun Feb 17 18:01:34 CET 2008

Hello,
here's my current Pd GUI wishlist, things that could streamline my work 
flow, things that don't seem logical to me...etc:

I wish:
-going in and out of edit mode was reflected by the cursor turning into 
a hand or arrow immediately, not requiring the user to move it first, 
who, if newbie, can get confused if he/she hasn't moved the mouse.
(this is the case on some versions I use in class, specifically 
pd-extended OSX I think)
-shift-click-and-drag on a number box would also work after you already 
clicked. Another idea: ctrl-click-drag to increment in steps of 10 or 100.
-home, end, shift+left/right, ctrl+left/right, ctrl+shift+left/right 
would work within object boxes just like in a text editor.
-click+drag a single object or messagebox wouldn't automatically 
activate text entry mode but the object itself stays the selection, so 
that you can move it again or use arrow keys for repositioning without 
having to deselect+reselect first.
-for a multiple connections facility, to connect all outlets of object a 
to all inlets of object b, and variations on that. (I think max has had 
this for a while, and maybe desiredata ?).
-'subpatcherize'
-that when deleting all text in a comment and clicking outside it, the 
comment would be deleted, so that if you save the patch, close it, and 
reopen it, there doesn't appear the word 'comment' everywhere you left a 
'blank' comment this way. Alternatively it could become 'comment' upon 
finalizing an empty comment, so that you can still see, select and 
delete it.
-the file browser (openpanel/savepanel) would support keystrokes to 
navigate: alt+up one dir up, tab to toggle focus between text entry and 
graphical area (where folders and files are displayed)...etc
-opening the filebrowser wouldn't cause the Pd main window to pop in 
front of all the patcher windows after it is closed.
-one object could be finalized by clicking the outlet of another object, 
so that you can immediately connect it. The extra click outside the 
object to finalize it first is unnecessary. When I click the outlet of 
another object, it is obvious that I am done typing the name of the 
current one.

Hi,
this list is great! I would like to add the one again that I posted 
yesterday (sorry for double posting, but this thread subject is better)

- when only one object is selected and you start typing (any other than 
arrows) it should be possible to write into the object without an 
additional click into the object. I often use ctrl+d to duplicate an 
object and then arrow keys to place it on the canvas, and then I would 
like to just start typing into the object.
- when there is more than one object selected and I click into one 
object, but do not drag, then that object could switch to type-entry 
mode. right now I have to unselect all objects by clicking into the 
canvas and then click into the box to start text entry.
- exiting entry mode with enter would actually be nice, too. (for 
messages cr could be shift+enter (the cr is overwritten anyway).
- more actions could be triggered by keyboard shortcuts?
-  the alt click and drag function. you click on an object and as soon 
as you start dragging that object is duplicated, but at the same time 
you already have the new object at the cursor position and can place it 
fast at a new spot.

I want to point out that in many cases this would mean different 
behaviour between clicking, and clicking+dragging.

plus new: keyboardshortcuts to bring the pd window to the front (to 
watch console output.
- and also change the cursor to arrow when you hit the command key to 
imply that clicking on messages or numbers has different behaviour (play 
mode) when you hit apple (or ctrl on win/lin?).

marius.
