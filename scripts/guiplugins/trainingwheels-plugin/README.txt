This plug sets up Pd to be simplified for beginners.  It deliberately hides some of the complexity of Pd so that people can focus on the essential parts as they are starting out with Pd.  It is meant to be integrated with the "Start Here" page on http://puredata.info and collection of examples.

This project was started at Eyebeam as part of an X-lab Residency and grew out of the NYC Patching Circle.
