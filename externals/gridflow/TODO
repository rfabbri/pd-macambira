<ClaudiusMaximus> hmm, sending a [reassign( message to the right inlet of a [#store] segfaults Pd

<ClaudiusMaximus> hmmm, i get a segfault with a simple patch sending "reassign, put_at ( 0 0 ), reassign" to the right inlet of [#store ( 3 3 # 0 )]

<alx1> matju: for the ./configure, I often get an error from aalib since common installs do not put the headers
<alx1> matju: would it be possible to make it a user defined choice like --with-aalib and turn it off by default?
<alx1> matju: not noticing that configure returns an error leads to an error when compiling
<alx1> back to the [display] object, it lingers for a moment after deletion
<alx1> and returns a 'pd_activate' error after I move it
<alx1> matju: once I delete it, unlike the other gui objects, it takes about one second before it dissapears, maybe a difference in tcl versions?

for 0.8.0:

drag_rectangle.pd is fucked (x11 error)
FObject#send_out2 : bself is NULL, rself=4097cbe8
[gf] ruby: ObjectSpace._id2ref(0x4097cbe8/2)

[147] [#store] blows up in nervous_video (reassign)
[146] [#peephole] resize problem
[145] "list -1"->[@import] only tells error message once every other time
[144] small leak remaining in x11. may have to do with non-use of XDestroyImage.

[140] is [@convolve] actually cross-convolution?
	that is, convolves with a mirror image of the convolution matrix.

	<mis> matju: BUG-ALERT - peephole does not delete until a screen refresh
	<mis> matju: I was just about to do that
	<mis> matju: it works... almost
	<mis> matju: if you try to move the GOPed abstraction the peepholes don't move along
	<mis> he :)  better yet, the abstraction's bounding box's lower right corner will not move up or to the left of the low right corner of the peephole it contains.  Instead it will resize itself as you move it around.

[137] [gf] peeperr: problem with set_geometry, wrong size.
[136] fix C_INCLUDE_PATH vs CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH

[128] jmax2pd(?): loadbang-messages (comma) don't get translated to .pd ??
[119] osx: SDL doesn't work here
[118] error messages can be unclear (eg. file not open... is it #in's, or #out's?)
[117] osx: [#store] crash instead of raising
[112] Pt<T>: some casts aren't done properly
[107] MMX computations may be done misaligned, which may be bad.
[105] when file not found, mpeg error messages are wrong, they say the filename is "".
[102] osx: error: shmget failed (cannot allocate memory) in X11, for regular pictures
[100] osx: libgridflow.so installs in wrong directory (of course)
[090] doesn't check whether ruby/version.h matches .so / .a
[027] tcp test is broken
[089] is LINK TO="..." not properly handled? see part of install.xml that uses it.
[088] FIX MOULINETTE.RB ! <attr name type default>
[078] "unsupported codec" bogus errors.
[097] bin/backtrace does not detect scripts
[005] can't open "": Success; loading a nonquicktime file using quicktime

[025] format_grid: write test for other bpv's
[026] latency is not that good. (GC ?)
[030] FormatGrid: not properly tested (crashes sometimes)
[031] stdout should be redirected if bridge is present
[032] error handling sometimes leads to crash
[033] error handling shows inanely useless messages (sometimes)

[038] some seeds aren't typechecked
[039] jpeg file cat crashes on second file (jpeglib buffering?)
[040] GRID_FINISH triggered while backstore ???

[076] EINTR not handled properly in a lot of code?
[041] what would be a way to make GF work well with Pd's idea of a list?
[043] TCP server socket busy even after kill
[045] write unit tests about required functionality
[046] write unit tests about error checking
[047] make system to ensure everything is working before a release.
[048] potential issues between fork() and X11 ?
[050] BitPacking has trouble with masks that extend beyond int25be
[051] remove the crap given by -w of ruby
[054] it's possible to crash by sending data in two inlets of a same object at once
[059] mess with options in format grid
[060] look for "!@#$" in source
[029] #join on small chunks is way too slow
[009] T_DATA #dup #clone ???

--- make the development process more test-driven:
    * file every feature request and bug report into base/test.rb so
      that gridflow fails those tests;
    * THEN make gridflow pass those tests.

===================

Community
[ ] put new examples on website

Distribution
[ ] should now plan which features are pre-1.0 and which are post-1.0
[ ] review all documentation
[ ] review all examples
[ ] make CDs

Installation
[ ] make the installer help the user more:
      * .h was found
      * compiled with .h correctly
      * .so|.a was found
      * linked with .so|.a correctly
[ ] installable doc
[ ] installable includes ?
[ ] produce linux binaries ("static")
[ ] produce cygwin32 or mingw32 binaries
[ ] produce macosx binaries
[ ] produce linux rpm/deb
[ ] less compile-time checks and more run-time checks
[ ] should GridFlow be bundled with some of its own dependencies?

[ ] make uninstall
[ ] have option for gprof
[ ] cross-compile:
	http://www.libsdl.org/extras/win32/cross/
	http://rooster.stanford.edu/~ben/linux/cross.php

Documentation
[ ] make a short feature list as a promo
[ ] add credits
[ ] indiquer comment faire un rapport à propos d'une carte v4l ou d'un mode x11 non-supporté
[ ] project_policy.xml

[ ] things you type verbatim are all in KBD blocks
[ ] placeholders for your own values are all in I blocks
[ ] document our own release procedures, how our CVS works
[ ] document how to report bugs, basic troubleshooting
[ ] document our distribution of the archives
[ ] ascii conventions: [foo] vs "foo", etc.
[ ] document internals
[ ] describe indexmap in doc
[ ] document backward compatibility issues
[ ] typical uses: <typical></typical>
[ ] architecture: class->type/shape->use->role
[ ] it should be indicated whether an object is supported by pd/ruby/c++
[ ] heavily hyperlink documentation
[ ] automate more parts of the documentation
[ ] benchmarks (especially: simple video i/o)
[ ] mimic [pdp_help_input] [pdp_help_output]: they are convenient
--- remember to keep doc/help/screenshots/examples up to date
[ ] <jtm_> the suggestion would be to add a link at the end of each section leading to the next section

Source Filter
[ ] add \ruby \end blocks (multiline inlined rubyscripts)
[ ] \attr

Architecture
[0.8] <pat> aussi les erreurs que donne gf c'est beaucoup de ligne pour juste un file not found ;)
[0.8] reentrancy of objects (to allow true recursion)
[0.8] inlet-variables (variables associated to inlets)

[0.8] dispatch on _n_-prefixed methods (one selector any inlet)
	  and     _#{i}_-named methods (any selector one inlet)
[0.8] generalize the backstore
[ ] Outlet#buffer should harmonise with the lcm of its corresponding Inlet#factor's.
[ ] lazy grids: Grid#operator Pt<T> makes sure all the grid is received
	and Grid#range(int start, int n, T bogus) makes sure the
	specified part of the grid is received.
[0.8] accounting: grids messages packets numbers bytes copybytes
[0.8] memory profiling
[0.8] compare Ruby API with both flext/pyext
[ ] add a "query" class for debugging other objects?
    (would be able to extract extra info from each object/class)
[ ] add a GridFlow::LaterException or something
    (which tells to retry later with the same packet because another
    grid reception is not completed yet.) 
[ ] interpret nested lists as n-dimensional.
[0.8] MMX memcpy() ?
[0.8] MMX _runtime_ autodetection

Operators
[ ] User-defined operators; compound operators... e.g. [# {{* 7} + {>> 3}}]

how about creating aliases like "open window" = "open x11 here" (or arbitrary
user-defined sequence of messages settable in ~/.gridflow_startup)  and "open
videodev" -> "open videodev /dev/video0, option channel 1, option size 240 320" 
maybe there should be a separate ~/.gridflow_config that would be saveable from
gridflow, and ~/.gridflow_startup would be edited only by the user but
~/.gridflow_config would still be a text file.  i say that
because the startup is a ruby script so gridflow couldn't just do
search-and-replace in there, because the option could be inside a "if"
expression and such... at most, gridflow could _append_ text to
.gridflow_startup, to be non-intrusive...

Feature Requests

From: Dave Bergevin <dabergevin@eisa.com> 
  [ ] synchronized audio with the video when using mpeg1 & 2
  [ ] full screen mode (without the menu bars or frames)
From: Alexandre Castonguay <acastonguay@artengine.ca>
  [ ] server side pd to handle multiple incoming commands, audio + video streams
  [ ] support for audio in the mpeg streams

<matju> alx:
 le tab completion ne donnerait pas seulement les noms possibles pour le
prochain argument dans le objectbox; il donnerait aussi une description de
l'argument (surtout dans le cas où l'argument a beaucoup de valeurs
possibles) 
 je pense que le help de Pd est une bonne idée (le concept hands-on)
mais ça pourrait aller plus loin. 
 j'ai pensé intégrer le manuel de référence de gridflow directement dans
le programme, disponible au runtime, dans l'éventualité d'un GUI qui
saurait en tirer avantage. sinon on pourrait faire des hacks cool genre un
message "help" au inlet 0 enverrait une description de la classe dans le log.
 (sauf que dans ce cas: [rubyprint] est tenu d'afficher directement tout
ce qu'il reçoit. alors doit-il écrire "help" ou écrire le help ? 

alx1->matju: détection de plusieurs personnes; détection avec deux caméras
(?);  détecter les formes; détecter les couleurs; support mpeg4; hotspots

... I am Jack's Overwritten Stack Pointer...

<ircbridge> <GPS> Tcl_GetObjResult Tcl_GetErrorInfo ...
<ircbridge> <GPS> Tcl_GetStringResult may also be helpful.  (note I can't
seem to find Tcl_GetErrorInfo (maybe I dreamed it up)) 
<ircbridge> <GPS> matju: BTW CatchObjCmd might help too
<ircbridge> <GPS> I see that the new Tcl_Dict commands have taken over the HEAD's CatchObjCmd

ClaudiusMaximus reports that allocating a 197M grid causes a crash (turns out C++
throws exception, can't allocate, signal ABRT)

ClaudiusMaximus says: I want to be able to send output from Pd+Gridflow to a video4linux
loopback device so that other v4l programs can access the stream.
I found the video loopback device here: http://motion.sourceforge.net/vloopback/

<alx2> matju: iSight on linux :
http://episteme.arstechnica.com/6/ubb.x?a=tpc&s=50009562&f=8300945231&m=40110681
<alx2> matju: apparently it needs something called 'coriander'...I'm checking into it
<alx2> matju: the person who got it working mentions libdc1394
<alx2> matju: ah coriander is a GUI for firewire
<alx2> matju: on this page :
http://www.tele.ucl.ac.be/PEOPLE/DOUXCHAMPS/ieee1394/cameras/index.html
<alx2> matju: I learn that the iSight is compliant with version 1.30 of IIDC
<alx2> matju: the docs for coriander mention that the author needed to create a major and minor device for the camera.
<alx2> matju: retyping (damn pdf's) -> there are two devices to create: raw1394 and video1394
<alx2> matju: raw1394 has major 171 and minor 0 while video1394 had major 171 and minor 16
<matju> thanks
<alx2> matju: any useful info?
<matju> i'll see, doing something else at the moment
<alx2> matju: having a camera like the iSight supported could be fantastic for video capture/detection on a laptop.  Not to mention that the bttv cards are getting harder to locate

-mfpmath=sse2

<MiS> <matju> alx2: btw you cannot set helpfiles explicitly on _abstractions_... 
<MiS> yes you can
<MiS> and specify -helppath to add a path to help.  So selecting 'Help'
      in the pop-up on an abstraction will open a help fiel for that abstraction

"Bangs in a geiger counter have a l*dt probability of occuring
 in a dt time interval. Therefore the time till the next event
 follows a Exp(l) law, for which:
 f(t) = l*exp(-l*t)
 F(t) = integral of l*exp(-l*t)*dt = 1-exp(-l*t)
 F^-1(p) = -log(1-p)/l
 //return (uint64)(1000LL*ms*-log(1-drand()));"
