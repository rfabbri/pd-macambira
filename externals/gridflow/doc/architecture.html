Grid Literals
	In every grid-accepting inlet, a list may be sent instead; if 
	it consists only of integers, it will be converted to a 
	one-dimensional grid. Else it may contain a single "#" sign and 
	integers on both sides of it, where the ones to the left of it are 
	fed as arguments to an imaginary [#redim] object and the one to the 
	right of it are fed through that [#redim]. 
 	In every grid-accepting inlet, an integer or float may also be sent; 
	it will be converted to a zero-dimensional grid (a scalar). 

Grid Protocol
	a grid has an associated number type that defines what are the possible values for its elements 
	(and how much space it takes). the default is int32. 
	a single-dimensional grid of 3 elements (a triplet) is called dim(3). a 
	three-dimensional grid of 240 rows of 320 columns of triplets is called 
	dim(240,320,3). 
 	There is a sequence in which elements of a Grid are stored and 
	transmitted.  Dimension 0 is called "first" and dimension N-1 is 
	called "last". They are called so because if you select a 
	position in the first dimension of a grid, the selected part is of the same 
	shape minus the first dimension; so in dim(240,320,3) if you select 
	row 51 (or whichever valid row number), you get a dim(320,3). if you select 
	a subpart two more times you get to a single number. 
 	At each such level, elements are sent/stored in their numeric order, 
	and are numbered using natural numbers starting at 0. This ordering usually 
	does not matter, but sometimes it does. Most notably, [#import], [#export] and [#redim] care about it. 
	On the other hand, order of dimensions usually does matter; this is 
	what distinguishes rows from columns and channels, for example. 
	Most objects care about the distinction. 
	A grid with only 1 element in a given dimension is different from one 
	lacking that dimension; it won't have the same meaning. You can use this 
	property to your advantage sometimes. 
	Zero-dimensional grids exist. They are called dim(). They can only contain 
	a single number. 
Picture Protocol
  This section is useful if you want to know what a picture is in terms of a grid.
  A picture is a three-dimensional Grid: 0:rows 1:columns 2:channels

Channels for the RGB color model are:  0:red 1:green 2:blue
 	Because Grids are made of 32-bit integers, a three-channel picture uses 
	96 bpp (bits per pixel), and have to be downscaled to 24 bpp (or 16 bpp) 
	for display. That huge amount of slack is there because when you create 
	your own effects you often have intermediate results that need to be of 
	higher precision than a normal picture. Especially, results of multiplications 
	are big and should not overflow before you divide them back to normal; 
	and similarly, you can have negative values all over, as long as you take 
	care of them before they get to the display.
 	In the final conversion, high bits are just ignored. This means: black is 
	0, maximum is 255, and values wrap like with % 256. If you want to 
	clip them, you may use [# max 0] and [# min 255] objects.

The following are called VecOps because each operation happens between more than just two numbers.
A first kind of VecOp are those that arise when a pair of numbers (A0,A1) is considered as a single number A0+A1*sqrt(-1).
If you need complex numbers but don't know yet how they work, learn them using a math tutorial and then those VecOps will begin to seem familiar.
All the complex number operators are only for floats.
TODO: fill the last two columns of this table.

Synchronisation

In GridFlow you cannot send two grids in different inlets at the 
same time. You have to use [#finished] together with (possibly) [fork] and [#store], 
which can be cumbersome. If you don't do this, the result is undefined 
behaviour (or crash!).
There are two exceptions: [#store] and # allow right-inlet grids to be buffered if an operation is occuring on left inlet. This 
should make many programs simpler.
