#X text 232 377 code for associating to a specific [doc_c] \, [doc_i]
or [doc_o]. for example \, to associate with [doc_c 3] \, the code
is c3;
#X text 232 425 in the case of [doc_i] or [doc_o] \, this is either
a selector or a meta-selector.;
#X text 232 556 the sorting order of [doc_m] elements in a given subsection
is alphabetical except for those five at the beginning: bang \, float
\, grid \, symbol \, pointer \, list. and this one at the very end:
<any>.;
#X text 232 617 a list of meta-selectors:;
#X text 232 639 <any>: represents the anything-method;
#X text 232 661 <none>: is for writing anything of interest (?) about
nothing at all. when present \, this is usually the only entry in the
given subsection \, and it usually just says that the inlet or outlet
is meant to be useless. typically \, no messages are accepted in the
inlet \, or else \, all messages are accepted without doing anything
with them \, or in the case of outlet \, nothing ever comes out of
it.;
#X text 232 796 <evil>: is like <none> \, except that the outlet that
bears it will do weird things to the object it gets connected to. things
that are very different from sending mere messages.;
#X text 232 866 <hpgl>: this stands for a pd message version of the
HPGL protocol.;
#X text 232 460 in the case of [doc_c] \, we're just faking that this
is a selector \, but you better only use atom types here: float \,
grid \, symbol \, pointer \, <atom>.;
#X text 232 844 <atom>: this stands for float \, grid \, symbol \,
or pointer.;
#X obj 97 981 doc_m o0 <none>;
#X obj 97 1001 doc_m o1 <evil>;
#X text 232 761 <gone>: is like none \, except the inlet or outlet
is completely missing.;
#X text 190 37 style guide for comments:;
#X text 190 59 do not say "accepts a grid that will do blah blah" \,
because all methods are accepting messages anyway. but do not say "a
grid that will do blah blah" \, because "grid" is already specified
by the [doc_m]. in some sentence structures it will be clearer to say
"the grid" in some places rather than not.;
#X text 232 508 a meta-selector is a name written within <> marks.
those represent special things that aren't really selectors \, as well
as sets of several selectors (or of many of them).;
#X text 190 142 say "image that will do blah blah" if an image is expected
\, but note that not so many objects really require images as inputs.
;
#X text 192 186 there is also a difference between hard limitations
\, and expected interpretations. for example \, if we say "an rgb image"
and mean it and are right about it \, then only 3-dimensional grids
will be accepted \, and only those with 3 elements in the last dimension
will be accepted \, but it is up to us to think of that last dimension
to represent rgb \, it is up to us to think that this last dimension
is channels \, and that the other dimensions are rows and columns.
however \, to ease the reading \, thinks like "(rows columns 3)" and
"rgb image" will be said even though much of GridFlow itself doesn't
care about it.;
