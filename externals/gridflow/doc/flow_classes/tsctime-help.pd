#X text 188 38 This is a super-high-resolution version of the [realtime]
class that does not look at the ordinary clock of the operating system
\, and instead uses the clock tick of the CPU itself. However \, if
you have a variable-clock CPU \, this will give you some kind of virtual
time.;

#X text 190 114 It's also possible that this has some other bugs related
to scaling. However \, even if it gives you really weird values \,
this object will give you very precise values in what is really the
wrong scale.;
#X text 192 171 if you are trying to measure real time with this \,
you should disable any CPU energy saving that may change the CPU's
clock speed. However \, if you want to measure CPU usage \, [tsctime]
is the ONLY of the time-objects to allow you to measure CPU usage reliably
while your clock speed changes.;
