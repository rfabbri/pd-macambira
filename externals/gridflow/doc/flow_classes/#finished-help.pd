#X text 90 85 this is a pattern where [t b a] doesn't cut it \, because
the bang would be output too early \, as it gets output at GRID_BEGIN
time (the time at which the grid message is sent). But [#convolve]
only outputs its contents after GRID_FLOW time \, which is what [#finished]
ensures. However you still need a [t a a] \, because [#finished]'s
GRID_FINISH time must happen after [#convolve]'s GRID_FINISH \, so
that you can be sure that [#convolve] is really finished with producing
its output.;

#X text 39 278 the 2nd exception is that it definitely doesn't support
any control-recursion (an object can't start processing a new message
before it has finished processing its message).;

#X msg 409 199;
#X text 40 327 the third exception is that the GRID atom type is not
officially recognised by PureData because PureData provides no means
for externals to register new atom types. You can see the effect of
this in how GEM uses the POINTER atom type in an unstable way (which
is also how GridFlow used to do it);
#X text 38 215 this is one of GridFlow's exceptions to how much grid-processing
is like normal pd message passing. there is also the [#t] class that
provides a shortcut for the most common use pattern of [#t].;
#X text 41 416 the fourth exception is that GridInlets support multiple
selectors with quite peculiar autocasts \, meaning that [# +] can't
support the equivalent of the 'list' message in the [+] class.;
#X text 40 479 much of the text of this page should really go somewhere
else \, but there is no place for it yet.;
