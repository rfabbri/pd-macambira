#X text 11 102 note that a zero value will cause pd to truncate the
symbol there. thus a symbol may have less bytes than the grid it was
made from.;
#X text 10 147 remember that a byte is not necessarily a codepoint
\, a codepoint is not necessarily a character \, and all characters
don't always have the same width. these distinctions don't matter for
all encodings.;
#X text 11 32 Produces a symbol from grid data in its input. The values
are expected to be valid in the character encoding that you are using
\, but no check will be performed for that \, and additionally \, no
check will be made that the generated symbol only contains characters
that can be put in a symbol.;

#X text 12 211 in the future \, this might work at the level of codepoints
instead. thus with today's default UTF-8 (compact unicode) encoding
\, &eacute \; has to be written as 195 169 \, you would be able to
write it as just 233 (as with iso-latin-1) and it would get converted
to 195 169 automatically. however there is still another form of this
character that is made as two codepoints \, 101 (e) and the "dead acute"
character \, separately \, on systems that support it.;
#X text 14 342 at this point \, though \, most branches of pd still
can't handle utf-8 properly \, so there isn't much of a hurry in adding
utf-8 support to [#to_symbol]...;
