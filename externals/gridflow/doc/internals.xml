<section name="notes">

<p>In Ruby, GridFlow defines a namespace (module) called GridFlow. Most  of the
constants it defines are part of that namespace.</p>
<p>Ruby does not have the same concept of object as PD. In GridFlow, object classes may
inherit features from other object classes, and also there is no concept of inlet nor outlet, which are instead
provided by <k>GridFlow::FObject</k>, which also has the purpose of exporting functionality to
PD.</p>
<p>In this document (and in many others) the phrase "a Potato" will be a shorthand for "an object of the class
called Potato", which is often used in modern software design and is a nice convention borrowed from
biology.</p>

<p>
A FObject is normally in two or three parts: a (Ruby) GridFlow::FObject
that is the central part; a (C++) FObject; a (C++) BFObject. 
The GridFlow::FObject is created as a RData kind of box (T_DATA) 
using Ruby-C's Data_Make_Struct on a GridObject. This is 
how most Ruby-C programs inherit from Ruby classes. Note that 
Ruby's boxed objects have a maximum of five fields, and they're usually 
taken, so additional fields have to be outside of it. This is why RData exists.
</p>		
		
<p>
So basically you have a C++ FObject that is "part of" a GridFlow::FObject 
and they point to each other using "peer pointers".
 The BFObject links back to the RData box through a pointer called peer.
