<section name="Documentation">
<list>
<li>
	Pictures identified as "&lt;help&gt;" should be screenshots of the
	help files. They shouldn't be screenshots of the template.
</li>
<li>
	A Help file is a visual summary of what an object does. It should be
	interactive and allow the user to understand what the object does.
	Sample inputs are provided and sample results can be seen.
</li>
<li>
	All modifications to the documentation must be done in the XML. The
	HTML must be kept up-to-date by rerunning "make" in the "doc/" directory.
</li>
<li>
	Help-wise, Formats are considered objects.
	Operators are to be documented as part of [@] and [@!].
</li>
<li>
	Images grabbed directly from a jMax window should be encoded in PNG.
	This includes "icons" (object boxes, message boxes, etc). If they are
	in JPEG, only change to PNG when the image has to change anyway.
	Distinguish "icons" from "thumbnails", the latter of which are
	<b>scaled-down</b> grabs, which should be encoded in JPEG.
</li>
<li>
	There are not help-thumbnails anymore in the reference manual
	because they were not helpful.
</li>
<li>
	Large images should be kept out of the release. The release itself must
	be small enough not to discourage us from doing releases and keeping
	them all. It also should be downloadable on a bad modem. =)
	Let's keep it under 500k please.
</li>
