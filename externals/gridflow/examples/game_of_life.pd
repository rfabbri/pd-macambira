#X text 18 14 this part at the left defines the rule of the game (this
is my own rewriting of the rules. it is equivalent to the original
but faster to compute.);
#X obj 28 83 # << (b # 1);
#X obj 28 122 # < (b # 3);
#X obj 28 103 #convolve (3 3 b # 0 0 0 0 1) \, op >> \, seed (b # 251)
;
#X text 26 173 This is about the fastest you can get in GridFlow. This
solution uses all the advanced dirty tricks you can imagine (and perhaps
some you can't).;
#X text 26 221 First I changed the convolution to use << so that *1
becomes <<0 and *2 becomes <<1 \, because << is faster than *. Then
I changed << to >> so that \, with a preceding <<1 \, <<0 becomes >>1
and <<1 becomes >>0. This is because #convolve knows that >>0 is doing
nothing (just like *1) and we want to have as many of those do-nothing
operations because they all get removed.;
#X text 25 322 Then the check for whether the result is 5 \, 6 or 7
is reduced to a subtraction of 5 \, and a check for whether the result
is 0 \, 1 or 2 This can be made by a single < by using the "b" (uint8)
type \, in which negative numbers don't exist (-1 = 255). I can include
the subtraction in the #convolve by using the seed \, but -5 can't
be written with a b type \, so you need to write 256-5 = 251 instead.
;
#X text 25 423 Those are all optional accelerations. You may want to
undo a few of those so that you have a patch that is more tweakable
\, but then you'd realise that it is the nature of the game of life
to not be very tweakable. This is one of the most sensitive formulas
you can find: most any change will completely destroy the pattern \,
changing it into either an explosion of noise or sudden death. There
are some difficult-to-find interesting tweaks \, but so far \, none
of them has given rich results like the game of life has.;
#X text 25 548 The original (3 3 # 2 2 2 2 1 2 2 2 2) is itself a shortcut
I devised so that I don't have to have separate rules for lit cells
and unlit cells. This is the only shortcut I'd keep in all versions
of this patch no matter how much tweaking I'd do.;
