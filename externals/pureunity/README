GOALS

  1. To provide a unit-test framework, which also provide benchmarking
     features, all made in Pd for use in Pd.

  2. To provide tests for functionality in internals, externals, abstractions, 
     etc., in a modularized way, in a DRY/OAOO fashion, thus abstracting out
     common features so that many objects share the same test patch for the 
     features that they have in common.

+-+-+--+---+-----+--------+-------------+---------------------+
REQUIREMENTS

  1. Pd 0.39 (PureMSP or Devel)

+-+-+--+---+-----+--------+-------------+---------------------+
TEST PROTOCOL

  new:
    create common (reusable) fixtures.

  inlet 0:
    bang:
      run all available tests in that class. individual tests don't have
      to be available through individual methods but may. If they do, the
      names of the methods must match those given in the test results. 

      each test should build its own non-reusable fixtures and reinitialize
      common fixtures, not assuming that the previous tests have left the
      common fixtures in a normal state.

  outlet 0:
    test results. a sequence of lists like:
      list $passed? $accuracy $elapsed $name1 ...

    where:
      $passed? is either 0 for failure or 1 for success
      $accuracy is a float proportional to relative error on math
         (if not applicable, use 0)
      $elapsed is a nonnegative float, the time elapsed in milliseconds
         or it is any negative float meaning the time hasn't been measured.
      $name1 and the rest are symbols and/or floats identifying the test

    for example:
      list 1 0 -1 commutative f + *

    Which means that the 1st test about commutativity passed ($2=1) because it
    was perfectly accurate ($3==0) and that we didn't measure the time ($4=-).

+-+-+--+---+-----+--------+-------------+---------------------+
SEVERITIES (in decreasing order)

 * crash: Segmentation Fault, Bus Error, Illegal Instruction, Infinite Loop, 
   etc.  You can't deal with those errors at the level of the tests. Maybe there 
   should be a way to tell a test object to skip certain tests, by name, in 
   order to be able to perform as many tests as possible while waiting for a 
   fix. It could become possible to rescue from some of those crashes if Pd
   supported exceptions (stack-unwinding).

 * corruption: this may cause future crashes and failures on innocent 
   objects/features. I have no solution for this except to be careful.

 * post(),error(),pd_error(): Gets printed in the console. The problem is that 
   those can't be handled by the test objects, so someone has to read them and 
   interpret them. Also they prevent test objects to ensure that error 
   conditions produce error messages.

 * pd_error2(): I wish this would exist. It would be sort of like pd_error() 
   but it would produce a pd message instead, whose selector would be an 
   error code, designed to be both localizable and [route]able. By default, that 
   message would be sent to the console, but there would be an internal class
   designed to catch those messages. (If stack-unwinding were possible, it would 
   be disabled by default on pd_error2 and could be enabled explicitly 
   by-selector).

 * failure: a test object reports a problem through outlet 0.

 * dropout: a failure in realtimeness... difficult for an object to detect.

 * inaccuracy: a test more or less succeeds but the test detected that the 
   epsilon sucks.

+-+-+--+---+-----+--------+-------------+---------------------+
PROTOCOL FOR [error]

new:
  optional argument which would either be a float
  (e.g. the $0 of the enclosing abstraction) or a pointer.

inlet 0:
  set $scapegoat:
    replaces the originator of the message by $scapegoat, which can be a
    float or a pointer

  error $1 ...:
    causes its arguments to be concatenated, space-separated (may include
    floats), and then sent through pd_error using the appropriate
    originator (scapegoat).

  list $1 ...:
    for future use. would use pd_error2() (see README or previous mail).
    $1 has to be a symbol.

+-+-+--+---+-----+--------+-------------+---------------------+
ACCURACY AND ERROR (in math-related unit tests)

The "absolute error" between a practical result and the expected value
is considered to be the distance between the two value. That is the
absolute value of the difference.

In the case of positions in 2D, 3D, etc., use the L2-Norm which is
a generalized Pythagoras' Theorem: dist^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + ...
A norm is a distance between something and zero.

Sometimes you have several practical results for one expected value
and must extract a single absolute error out of that. Then you should pick
the largest of the individual absolute errors.

Sometimes you don't have an expected value, you just have several
practical results that you expect to be quite the same. In that case,
the absolute error is the "diameter" of those results. The meaning
of diameter here is: the largest distance between any two results.

If in a single test you must compare 2D errors with 3D errors and 1D
errors, etc., you may have to adjust them by dividing the error by
the square root of N (N is the number of dimensions). In that case,
the resulting value is called a RMS (Root-Mean-Square).

The maximum error introduced by just representing a number as a float
(instead of an exact value) is at most proportional to the magnitude
of the number (e.g. usually 16 million times smaller: about 6 decimals).
Also, often we are only interested in relative error, which is absolute
error divided by the norm of the expected result, because small absolute
errors don't matter much with large results. This is the reason floats
exist in the first place. By default, use relative error as the $accuracy
in Pd tests.

If you don't have an expected result, then compute the relative error as
being the absolute error divided by the norm of the average of practical
results.

In the RMS case of relative error, the norms of expected results should also
be adjusted, but both adjustments cancel because they get divided by each
other. That means: don't divide by the sqrt(N) at all and you'll get an
appropriate result.

+-+-+--+---+-----+--------+-------------+---------------------+
TYPE PREFIXES

Those have to be prefixes in order to be honored by DOLLSYM:
[$1norm] should expand to [fnorm], [lfnorm], [#norm], etc.

Those prefixes are necessary in order to achieve polymorphism through
abstraction arguments.

CURRENT:
  f   float
  ~   signal

FUTURE (from PureData):
  s   symbol
  p   gpointer
  a   anything
  l   list (of whatever)
  lf  list of floats
  ls  list of symbols
  lp  list of pointers

FUTURE (from DesireData):
  t   stringpointer
  L   listpointer
  v   varpointer (instance symbol)

FUTURE (from GridFlow):
  #   grid (of whatever)
  #b  grid of bytes (uint8)
  #s  grid of shorts (int16)
  #i  grid of ints (int32)
  #l  grid of longs (int64)
  #f  grid of floats (float32)
  #d  grid of doubles (float64)
  #r  grid of rubies (VALUE*)

for a type prefix to be considered implemented, it has to
have the following class set:

  metaabstraction   for floats   for signals   for grids
  [$1.inlet]         [inlet]      [inlet~]      [inlet]
  [$1.outlet]       [outlet]     [outlet~]     [outlet]
  [$1.do $2 $3]     [$2 $3]      [$2~ $3]      [# $2 $3]
  [$1.taa]          [t a a]      noop          [t a a]
  [$1.swap]         [swap]       noop          TODO
  [$1.norm]         [abs]        [env~]        [# sq]->[#ravel]->[#fold +]->[#export]->[sqrt]
  [$1.packunpack3]  pack,unpack  noop          TODO

The first two cannot be implemented as abstractions and instead must be
defined as aliases in pureunity.c.

extra metaabstractions:
  [$1.rand]         [f.rand]     [~.rand]TODO  [#.rand]TODO

+-+-+--+---+-----+--------+-------------+---------------------+
OTHER PROTOCOLS

Those four classes are operators that give verify algebraic properties
of other operators. The more their outputs are close to zero, the more
those other operators are faithful to an algebraic property.

(here, supported $types are f and ~)

[commutator  $type $class]          (2 inlets)     ab-ba
[associator  $type $class]          (2 inlets)  (ab)c-a(bc)
[distributor $type $class1 $class2] (3 inlets) a&(b^c)-(a&b^a&c)
[invertor    $type $class1 $class2] (2 inlets)   ab/b-a

+-+-+--+---+-----+--------+-------------+---------------------+
TESTS AND RULES

For each class, a test file's name is the class name followed by "-test.pd",
and a rule file's name is the class name followed by "-rule.pd",
in the same way as it is for help files.

for a class called $foo, the protocol (aka interface aka rule) $foo is the
set of behaviours expected from the $foo class; the class called $foo-rule
must repect the $foo protocol as well, plus it should test that the inputs
are valid, and if they are, it should test for one or several results and
report any errors.

(((To report errors and inaccuracies, output them through the properties outlet at the right. If there is no
properties outlet in $foo (curently almost nothing in Pd has one),
then $foo-rule must have one more outlet than $foo.)))

(((Float messages coming out of the properties outlet of $foo-rule report
accuracy. Named error messages come out with selector "error" followed by
an error-symbol and then its arguments.)))

(((In the case of true/false logic, a value of 0 means that a test has passed
and a 1 means that a test has failed. Those values represent failure and not
success. The reason is so that it matches with accuracy levels, where 0 is
perfectly accurate, but any inaccuracy shows up as a relative error fraction.
Any finite nonnegative value is allowed for accuracy, because it is expected
to be the result of a norm))).

(((In standard math, "Discrete Metric" is when there are only two possible
distances between objects: together=0 and apart=1)))

+-+-+--+---+-----+--------+-------------+---------------------+
RANDOMIZERS (?)

+-+-+--+---+-----+--------+-------------+---------------------+
ETC


(write me!)




If +-test.pd tests [+], it can test for hotness, coldness, it can test
that only one result is produced per hot message, that all results are
float, that a few example additions work, and that with random inputs it
respects commutativity, associativity, invertibility, within appropriate
relative-error bounds, etc.

However +-test.pd can't test that errormessages aren't printed during the
testing. This may be something that we want to check for, and currently
the best way to handle it is to search the console for error messages, and
if there are any, restart the tests in verbose mode and see where the
error happens exactly.

[...]

Floating-point is the scientific notation for numbers that we all
learned on paper in school. Rounding and inaccuracy are two sides
of the same coin. They are required when it is stupid to have perfect
results, that is, when it would mean too many computations for little
gain.

However sometimes we want to make sure that our math is accurate enough.
Many algorithms are data-recursive: each computation uses previous
results. Many of those algorithms have chaotic and/or unstable
behaviours, which means that the inaccuracies may skyrocket instead of
fading out.

I find unit-tests to be often decomposable like this. Start with something
like this:

  raise if Blah.new(666) != Blah.new(666)
  raise if Blah.new(747) != Blah.new(747)
  raise if Blah.new(242) != Blah.new(242)
  raise if Blah.new(69)  != Blah.new(69)
  raise if Blah.new(37)  != Blah.new(37)

then generalize it ("equality is defined based on the arg of .new"):

  for x in [666,747,242,69,37] do
    raise if Blah.new(x) != Blah.new(x)
  end

then extract a contract from it:

  class CheckedBlah < Blah
    def self.new(x)
      r = super(x)
      raise if r != super(x)
      r
    end
  end

so now all Blah object creation may be checked throughout actual uses of a
program and not just unit tests. The unit test now reduces to:

  for x in [666,747,242,69,37] do Blah.new(x) end

so for many unit tests, all you have to do is just do things and discard
the results, and the contract will do the job of checking.

Here's another way to factor unit-tests that I haven't mentioned in the
last mail.

suppose you test for + using:

  class IntegerTest
    def test; 2+2==4 or raise; end
  end
  class FloatTest
    def test; 2.0+2.0==4.0 or raise; end
  end
  class RationalTest
    def test; Rational(2,1)+Rational(2,1)==Rational(4,1) or raise; end
  end

you can refactor those tests like this:

  class NumericTest
    def initialize nt; @nt; end
    def make x; raise "abstract class" end
    def test; make(2)+make(2)==make(4) or raise; end
  end
  class  IntegerTest; def make x;  Integer(x)   end end
  class    FloatTest; def make x;    Float(x)   end end
  class RationalTest; def make x; Rational(x,1) end end

That was a pretty bad case of strawman argument. Dean was assuming that
your documentation was not executable when you had quite clearly stated
that it was the contracts that acted as documentation!

Let's follow the argument of both of you to the end.

1. Unit-tests often match inputs with outputs on a case-by-case basis.

2. Redundancy should be eliminated.

(1) suggests that there is a shorter way to express the unit-tests.
Suppose you are able to find a formula for generating output-validators
from inputs. Then that formula is a postcondition of a contract, and the
explicit output-validators of the unit-tests are redundant.

(2) because part of the unit-tests are redundant, part of the unit-tests
should be eliminated. This causes the postconditions to become an
essential part of unit-testing.

Unit-tests vs contracts is a false debate.

Subject: macros and such (was: pd-lib, SIMD)

[...]

I think that the Pd source doesn't use nearly enough macros or other
code-reducing tricks.

The reduction of code isn't so much about making things use less RAM: the
RAM excuse is quickly evaporating as even the tiniest computers come with
plenty of RAM and even the faster kinds of RAM come in ever more copious
amounts (big caches).

The reduction of code is programmer-oriented. I'm not talking about length
of identifiers here (this is a separate issue). Every line of code should
do something interesting by itself. Code should read like a good story and
not like a car. Ever tried to read a car? It's boring. The same damn
piston copy-pasted 12 times.

The reduction of code is also documentation-oriented. Once the programmer
has been contaminated with the wisdom required to make small code or
understand small code, then why wouldn't the programmer explain it to his
students in higher-level terms instead of chanting 12 times the same
piston as if it were a marathon of Hail-Marys ?

This is why Pd needs a taxonomy of object classes. If I don't get that
taxonomy in Pd itself nor in its help files, at least I'll have it in its
unit tests.

Once and only once.
Once and only once.
Once and only once.
Three strikes and you refactor.
for x in [1,2,3] say: Once and only once

http://c2.com/cgi/wiki/?ThreeStrikesAndYouRefactor

BTW I'm not talking about only inheritance of implementations. The most
important thing to me is inheritance of expectations, so that if I name
100 classes that obey the rule "Operator2", then you have just learned
something common about 100 classes.

Operator2 means right-inlet is cold, left-inlet is hot, there is a "set"
method for using left-inlet as cold, there is a "bang" for explicitly
activating the main computation. The main computation only produces one
message. That's what "Operator2" means in my taxonomy, and it's that much
that hasn't to be stated explicitly in each help patch.

Help patches can be abstractions to be used to by other help patches. Just
put a [operator2-help] object in your help patch to indicate that the
currently documented class obeys the standard operator2 rules.

Who's against it?

I agree. Many objects obey the rule that the k'th inlet matches argument
$k for several arguments in a row, usually all of them.

And the best way to make sure people are following a standard is to make 
it so easy to follow that it's harder to not follow it than to follow it. 
Of course I don't mean adding hurdles to doing it otherwise, but rather 
make a shortcut for those who follow the standard. Short of this, people 
who make abstractions/externals can get a friendly reminder, from someone 
who cares, that it would be better if they followed the standard.

PureUnity's goal (when I work on it) is to design a taxonomy that 
separates objects that obey certain properties, from those that don't, 
because that's a way to reuse tests, but also because certainly it doesn't 
hurt documentation either, and it's even better if it can influence how 
abstractions are made.

From matju@artengine.ca on Dec 18, 2006

I thought up some kind of classification of type systems, avoiding to call
them strong/weak or static/dynamic because those words are confusing.

1. Typed expressions: each piece of code that can give a value, has a
type that can be figured out at compile-time.

2. Typed variables/parameters: declarations allow runtime checks but not
compile-time checks.

3. Typed values: variables don't have types, they can contain any value,
but every value has a type.

4. Typed uses: values don't have types, a type is a way of using a value.

Strictness, in the sense of forbidding things to the user, is not on that
scale, it's another aspect. A well-balanced strictness allows one to
bypass the system whenever needed, but without being too error-prone.

However it's difficult to say what it means to "bypass the system" for all
four typing categories at once, or even within one category.
