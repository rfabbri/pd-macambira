libdir

This package provides support for the libdir format of libraries that is used
in Pd-extended.  It should work with any version of Pd 0.40 or newer.

To install, copy the files for your platform into your "extra" folder and the
help patches to the "doc/5.reference" folder.  You will need to load the
libdir.dll/libdir.pd_linux/libdir.pd_darwin as a library before trying to load
any libdirs.  The libdirs have to be in the global classpath in order to be
found.

You can add a library two ways:
 - add this text to one of the fields in the "Startup" prefs:  libdir
 - load it on the command line with this:  -lib libdir

For more info on the structure of libdirs, see this webpage:

http://puredata.org/docs/developer/Libdir

If you want to compile these yourself, it will be much easier to compile it
out of the pure-data CVS.  Otherwise, just drop these into any working
externals build system and they should compile, they are very simple C files.
